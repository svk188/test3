You can use custom sound bank to make generator sound better. All you need is to put .sf2 file in this directory and use it in RealtimePlayer.java
I strongly suggest you to download free soundbank Fluid R3, which includes all the Midi instruments.

Instructions:
1. Download soundfont from here: http://www.musescore.org/download/fluid-soundfont.tar.gz
2. Extract it to /soundfonts
3. Rename the file to fluid.sf2 or change constant SOUNDFONT_FILENAME in /src/player/RealtimePlayer.java
4. Enjoy the new amazing sound of generator :)
